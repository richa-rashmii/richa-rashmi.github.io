    <p>
        I am Richa Rashmi pursuing a Masters of Science in Information Technology & Management with specialization in the ERP Track. I have gained 4.5 years of work experience at Infosys Limited in the SAP Domain where I acquired expertise in SAP HANA Administration, optimization of system performance using Solution Manager, automated remediation using CPS-Redwood RunMyJob, SAP ILM Archiving, and Salesforce Monitoring. I was enthralled by the work that always motivated me to develop a keen interest in learning ERP Systems. With the zeal to continue my journey in SAP, I am aspiring to specialize in the ERP Track offered by UT Dallas. The curriculum provides a perfect amalgam of technical, business, and management courses, which are essential for managing an organization's IT resources and will be a great match for my experience and aspirations. I am also an active member of Student Organizations - INFORMS at UT Dallas and SAP User Group. Apart from learning, I understand the importance of giving back to society and therefore have been enthusiastically volunteering at FMSC to bring social impact in the lives of kids.

        <br>I consider myself a curious comet of UTD looking for some exciting opportunities to learn, work, enjoy, and contribute at the same time!

                    As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at The University of Texas at Dallas, my role has been characterized by a commitment to fostering an enriched learning environment and creating impactful experiences for students. 
                    Engaging in Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) within the Capstone section has been a transformative aspect of my experience. Coordinating teams, clients, and projects with Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, 
                    I have witnessed the power of cross-cultural collaboration in enhancing the educational journey. This initiative has not only broadened the horizons of our students but has also cultivated a global perspective, contributing to a 30% increase in their overall learning experience. 
                    Through the integration of COIL, students have been exposed to diverse viewpoints, challenged to think critically, and equipped with skills crucial for success in our interconnected world. This collaborative approach has not only benefited the students directly involved but has also had a ripple effect, enriching the entire learning community.
                </p>
                <p>   
                    In addition to my involvement in COIL, I have played a pivotal role in the development of course material, providing proficient techno-functional support in SAP Labs. This dual role has allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application, ensuring that students are well-prepared for the demands of the industry. 
                    Through my efforts, I have actively assisted students with grades, assignments, and constructive feedback, contributing to a remarkable 20% improvement in overall student performance. This achievement reflects not only my dedication to the academic success of students but also my ability to create a supportive and enriching learning environment. 
                    By focusing on individualized feedback and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, I have strived to empower students with the skills and knowledge necessary for success in their academic and professional endeavors.
