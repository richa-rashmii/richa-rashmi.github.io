                    <p>
                        As a Graduate Teaching Assistant at The University of Texas at Dallas, my role has been characterized by a commitment to fostering an enriched learning environment and creating impactful experiences for students. 
                        Engaging in Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) within the Capstone section has been a transformative aspect of my experience. Coordinating teams, clients, and projects with Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, 
                        I have witnessed the power of cross-cultural collaboration in enhancing the educational journey. This initiative has not only broadened the horizons of our students but has also cultivated a global perspective, contributing to a 30% increase in their overall learning experience. 
                        Through the integration of COIL, students have been exposed to diverse viewpoints, challenged to think critically, and equipped with skills crucial for success in our interconnected world. This collaborative approach has not only benefited the students directly involved but has also had a ripple effect, enriching the entire learning community.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        In addition to my involvement in COIL, I have played a pivotal role in the development of course material, providing proficient techno-functional support in SAP Labs. This dual role has allowed me to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application, ensuring that students are well-prepared for the demands of the industry. 
                        Through my efforts, I have actively assisted students with grades, assignments, and constructive feedback, contributing to a remarkable 20% improvement in overall student performance. This achievement reflects not only my dedication to the academic success of students but also my ability to create a supportive and enriching learning environment. 
                        By focusing on individualized feedback and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, I have strived to empower students with the skills and knowledge necessary for success in their academic and professional endeavors.

                <p>During the summer of 2023, I had the distinct privilege of coordinating Dr. Michael Benson's visit to UTD for a discussion on the Capstone Course.

                    This included arranging and booking reservations at local restaurants to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience along with students and clients. 
                    <br>Additionally, I proactively communicated with students, disseminating pertinent information and instructions via email to optimize their engagement with Dr. Benson's visit. Behind the scenes, I worked diligently to guarantee that every aspect of the visit unfolded seamlessly, creating an environment conducive to a successful and enriching discussion on the Capstone Course.</p>
